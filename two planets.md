# The two planets

If Falicornia attacks Lengaburu with 2 Horses, 2 Elephants, 2 Armoured Tanks and 2 Sling Guns, Lengaburu will win the war if King Shan matches the attack with 1 Horse, 1 Elephant, 1 Armoured Tank and 1 Sling Gun.
But not so fast! Al Falcone will surely attack with a larger army. Your coding challenge is to identify what battalions, and how many units of each battalion King Shan should deploy to match Al Falcone's attack.

## The rules of war

Lengaburuâ€™s army has 100 Horses, 50 Elephants, 10 Armoured Tanks and 5 Sling Guns

### Rules

1. The **Power Rule**: Each Lengaburu army unit is 2X more powerful than their Falcornia counterpart.

   *Example*: 1 Lengaburu Horse can counter 2 Falicornia Horses, 1 Lengaburu Elephant can counter 2 Falicornia Elephants and so on.

2. The **Like-to-Like Rule**: Falicornia Horses battalion should be countered with Lengaburu horses battalion, Elephants with elephants and so on. Except when the battalion is completely exhausted.

   *Example*: If Falicornia deploys 2 H, 4 E, 0 AT and 6 SG, Lengaburu should counter with 1 H, 2 E, 0 AT and 3 SG.

3. The **Substitution Rule**: When all units of a particular Lengaburu battalion is exhausted, an adjacent battalion can be used. 1 Elephant can replace 2 Horses (and 2 Horses can replace 1 Elephant), 1 Armoured Tank can replace 2 Elephants (and vice versa) and 1 Sling Gun can replace 2 Armoured Tanks (and vice versa). Note that only adjacent battalions can be used for substituting. Horses cannot replace Sling Guns as they are not adjacent.

   *Example*: If Falicornia deploys 204 H, 20 E, 0 AT and 0 SG, Lengaburu should counter with 100 H, 11 E (1 Elephant has substituted 2 Horses which got exhausted at 100)
   Example: If Falicornia deploys 0 H, 0 E, 14 AT and 12 SG, Lengaburu should counter with 0 H, 0 E, 9 AT and 5 SG (2 AT has substituted for 1 SG which got exhausted at 5)

4. The **Substitution Choice Rule**: When there are 2 possibilities of substitution, then always a lower ranked battalion should be used (Horses is lower than Elephants, is lower than Armoured Tanks, is lower than Sling Guns)

   *Example*: If Falicornia deploys 50 H, 104 E, 6 AT and 2 SG, Lengaburu should counter with 29 H, 50 E, 3 AT and 1 SG (4 Horses substituted for 2 Elephants instead of the higher ranked Armoured Tanks)

## Examples

### Sample I

**Input:** Falicornia attacks with 100 H, 101 E, 20 AT, 5 SG

**Expected Output:** Lengaburu deploys 52 H, 50 E, 10 AT, 3 SG and **wins**

### Sample II

**Input:** Falicornia attacks with 150 H, 96 E, 26 AT, 8 SG

**Expected Output:** Lengaburu deploys 75 H, 50 E, 10 AT, 5 SG and **wins**

### Sample III

**Input:** Falicornia attacks with 250 H, 50 E, 20 AT, 15 SG

**Expected Output:** Lengaburu deploys 100 H, 38 E, 10 AT, 5 SG and **loses**
